# Overview

stringplay is a data collection service that aggregates attendee information from your online spreadsheets and surveys, allowing you to effectively track event and membership data.

### Use Cases

- **Track Your Membership**
  
  If you determine membership for your organization via attending events, this will allow you to keep track
  of your members through sign in sheets and logs.
  
- **Surveys and Newsletters**
  
  You can use your data to send surveys and newsletters to your audience in bulk, and even personalize your 
  emails based on what event they were a respondent for.

- **Data Transformation**
  
  You can transform the data on the spreadsheet provided to you by using it on other spreadsheets. For
  example, you could perform operations on a subset of your audience based on the events they've attended,
  or the amount of membership points they have.
