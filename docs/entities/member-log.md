# Member Log

The member log is where you can see all the information for your audience. In the console, it includes a couple of sections

- The Membership Information section shows an overview of each member's properties
- The Events Attended section shows an overview of the events that each member has attended
- The Membership Points section shows the amount of points each member has, corresponding to each point type. This section is only visible if you have at least one event with a point value assigned.
